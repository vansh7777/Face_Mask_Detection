# Face_Mask_Detection

Here we have a Dataset which consists of a large number of images which consists of both masked image and unmasked images and we have classified the images accordingly with the help of different classifiers like Decision Tree Classifier and MLP Classifier and Logistics Regression Classifier.


Face recognition represents one of the most interesting modalities of biometric. Due to his low intrusiveness and to the constant decrease in image acquisition cost, itâ€™s particularly suitable for a wide number of real time applications. In this paper we propose a very fast image pre-processing by the introduction of a linearly shaded elliptical mask centered over the faces. Facial recognition studies the features around the eye, nose, mouth, and ears to identify an individual to determine whether the individual is wearing a mask or not.
